# Cas-Compiler

Edited a grammer file to include that variables must be initialized when declared, a '-' operator, a do-while loop, and a print statement that can print any number of values.

Set-up assumes that you have java, javac, and nasm already installed on your environment.

To install NASM and generate 32-bit executables with the gcc C compiler:
$ sudo apt-get install nasm
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
